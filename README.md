# Data Science for Sustainable Agriculture

## Introduction

Agriculture  is  one  of  the  primary  sectors  of  the  global  economy,  and  sustainable  agricultural practices  are  crucial  for  ensuring  food  security,  environmental  conservation,  and  economic growth. However, climate change and environmental degradation pose significant challenges to sustainable agriculture. To address this challenge, data science techniques can be used to study the dynamics and present insights that can help farmers and policymakers make more informed decisions and reduce the environmental impactof agriculture. This project focuses on studying the effects of 
1) Methane Turbulent Flux
2) Ecosystem Respiration
3) MODIS EVI (greenness of grassland) with respect to environmental variables.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is emitted during agricultural activities such as livestock management   and   rice   cultivation.   The   prediction   of   methane   emissions  from   available environmental  variables  such  as  solar  radiation,  air  temperature,  soil  temperature,  relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit can aid in developing sustainable agricultural practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Ecosystem respiration is a critical process that plays a crucial role in carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. The prediction of ecosystem respiration from environmental variables can aid in the understanding  of  the  carbon  balance  in  agricultural  systems  and  help  develop  management practices that reduce carbon losses.

MODIS  EVI  is  an  indicator  of  the  greenness  of  grassland  and  can  provide  valuable  information about vegetation productivity. The prediction of MODIS EVI from environmental variables such as solar radiation, air temperature, soil temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit can  aid  in  understanding  the  dynamics  of  grassland  productivity  and  provide  insights  into sustainable management practices.

This project will provide an overview of the data science techniques used for prediction and an analysis of the results. The datasets for this study are provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
